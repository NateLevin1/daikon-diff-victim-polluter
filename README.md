# Takuan

Takuan is a framework for analyzing and root causing OD tests using dynamic invariants generated by Daikon. Given an OD test, Takuan finds differences in the invariants collected from passing and failing runs, outputting “problem invariants”. Takuan then searches for methods that influence the problem invariants.

## Usage

### To automatically run all:

```bash
./takuan.sh <gitURL> <sha> <victim> <polluter> (<module>)
```

### To run scripts individually:

To get the `.inv` files, go to any Java 8 Maven project and run:

```bash
./daikon-gen-victim-polluter.sh <com.example.Test.victimMethod> <com.example.Test.polluterMethod>
```

> **Note**
>
> If you are having problems during the DynComp stage, try setting `NO_DYNCOMP=1`.
> If you are having problems during the Chicory stage, try ignoring individual classes by name using `IGNORED_CLASSES='some|regex'`

Then analyze the generated logs with:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="daikon-pv.inv daikon-victim.inv daikon-polluter.inv"
```

Or:

```bash
mvn package
java -cp target/classes:daikon-5.8.16.jar in.natelev.daikondiffvictimpolluter.DaikonDiffVictimPolluter daikon-pv.inv daikon-victim.inv daikon-polluter.inv
```

Or, go to the folder where you ran `daikon-gen-victim-polluter.sh` and run:

```
/path/to/daikon-diff-victim-polluter.sh
```

Provide a `-o output.dinv` argument to write the results to a file.

To just run the test with the polluter (no logs will be generated):

```bash
./daikon-victim-polluter.sh test <com.example.VictimTest> <com.example.PolluterTest>
```

If the Java process runs out of memory during processing, you should try again with `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=50.0` or a higher number.
